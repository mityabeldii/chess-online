### Demo
You can check [Live Demo here](https://tik-toe-toy-online-d475f.firebaseapp.com).

All the commands to build, deploy push and commit are in `package.json`.

This project is sette up with two main technologies:
 - [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
 - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
 
 To work width dates we are using `moment-timezone` npm library.
 `styled-compontns` is a perfect tool to deal with CSS in react and change style dynamicly.

# ReactJS + Firebase

First, this is a `npm` project, so you need to have several command line tools:
 - [`node` and `npm`](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html)
 - [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
 - [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)
 - [`firebase-tools`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#macos)


## React
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
